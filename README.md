Lecture notes for MA3D5 Galois Theory at University of Warwick, 2023/24.

The notes are finished but not necessarily free from errors.

The module comprises formulas for solving quadratic and cubic polynomials, methods indicating whether a polynomial in Z[x] is irreducible, results about field extensions, automorphism group of a field and finally Galois correspondence and its application to finite fields and solubility of polynomials.
